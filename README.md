# My-PhD-Interview

I will write down the experiences of my PhD interviews in this page!
:)

# Experiences
As far as I know, the most important factors that influnce the result of my application are ***connection***, ***interview*** and ***opening***.

***connection***: means whether has a chat or email exchange with the professor. (It would be better if worked with the professor before or with a strong recommendation letter).

***interview***: means whether you perform well in the interview with the professor or committee. (That's really important and take care all the time!)

***opening***: means whether the professor has an opening this year. (Note that it may change!)

In conclusion, I find considering as many professors and universities as possible works.
